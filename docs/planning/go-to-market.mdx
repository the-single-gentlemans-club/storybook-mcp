# Go-to-Market Strategy

## The Mindset

You don't launch to get 5 customers. You **find** 5 customers and build with them.

The product shipped at day 60 is not for the internet. It's for 5 specific people whose exact pain you understand. Everything in this GTM is oriented toward that.

## Target Customer Profile

```
✓ 2–10 person startup
✓ Has at least one designer + one developer
✓ Shares a Figma file they actively maintain
✓ Has a React codebase
✓ Feels the design/dev gap pain (already looking for solutions)
✗ Not: enterprises (too slow to close), solo devs without Figma (no design layer)
```

## Positioning

**Not**: "design-to-code tool" (saturated, baggage from bad generators)

**Not**: "design system sync" (too vague, nobody knows what they're buying)

**Yes**: "Your AI finally knows your design system"

The positioning locks onto the AI angle because:
1. It's differentiated — no competitor can say this
2. It's immediately understood by anyone using Claude or Cursor
3. It creates curiosity instead of comparison

### The One-Line Pitch

> *"ForgeKit tells your AI exactly what's been built and what hasn't — so your whole team stops guessing."*

## Pre-Launch (Weeks 1–2, Runs Parallel to Building)

Before writing a line of product code, talk to 10 startup founders or leads.

**The goal**: Not to sell. To hear their exact words describing the pain.

**The question**: *"What's the most painful part of keeping your Figma and code in sync?"*

**Where to find them**:
- Your existing network (fastest, highest conversion)
- Twitter/X mutuals who post about design systems or Storybook
- Figma Community — people who publish community files care about design systems
- Storybook Discord
- Design Systems Slack (design.systems/slack)

**What you'll hear** (and what it becomes in copy):
- *"I never know what's actually been built"* → "Know exactly what's built and what's not"
- *"New devs take forever to understand our components"* → "New hires productive on day one"
- *"We keep rebuilding stuff that already exists"* → "Stop rebuilding what you already have"

## The Demo Video

One 90-second screen recording. No voiceover. The output speaks.

```
Scene 1 (10s):  Terminal — forgekit sync running, 47 components found
Scene 2 (20s):  Claude — "what's not built yet?"
                Claude lists unbuilt components with Figma links
Scene 3 (25s):  Claude — "what drifted from Figma this week?"
                Claude: specific component names, token mismatches
Scene 4 (25s):  Claude — "I'm new here, walk me through the design system"
                Claude gives full structured onboarding
Scene 5 (10s):  Terminal — forgekit status with health metrics
```

**The launch tweet:**

> *"I got tired of my team not knowing what was built vs designed. So I built this."*
> [video]

Tag nobody. Don't explain it. Let people ask in the replies.

## Channel Strategy

### Phase 1 (Weeks 4–6): Direct Outreach

Send 20 DMs to startup founders/leads you already follow. The message:

```
"Hey — building something that might be relevant to you.

It's an MCP that gives Claude complete awareness of your design
system — Figma components, what's built, what's drifted, what's
missing.

Basically answers 'what do we have and what's not built yet'
instantly. PM, dev, and design all get the same answer.

Would you try it with your actual codebase? Free, 30-min setup
call, I handle everything. Honest feedback is all I want."
```

Expect 4–6 yes replies from 20 sends. Those become your beta cohort.

### Phase 2 (Weeks 4–8): Communities

| Community | What to Post | Timing |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Design Systems Slack | "Built something that gaps your Figma/code — feedback?" | Week 4 |
| Storybook Discord | "ForgeKit Context MCP — Storybook-aware context for Claude" | Week 5 |
| Figma Community | Comment on popular component files | Week 6 |
| Twitter/X second post | Real quote from a beta user | Week 6 |
| Dev.to / Hashnode | Technical deep-dive: matching algorithm | Week 7 |

### Phase 3 (Week 12+): Public Launch

ProductHunt after beta feedback is incorporated. Not before. Launching on ProductHunt with rough edges kills momentum.

## Beta Cohort Structure

5 startups. They get:

```
✓ Free access forever (this cohort only)
✓ 30-minute onboarding call (done together)
✓ Weekly 15-minute check-in for 4 weeks
✓ Direct Slack/Discord channel
✓ Logo on landing page (optional)
✓ Price lock when paid tier launches
```

You get:

```
✓ Real messy codebases breaking your matching algorithm
✓ Real Figma files with naming inconsistencies
✓ Workflow patterns you didn't design for
✓ Testimonials and case studies
✓ Referrals (startups talk to each other constantly)
```

The first 5 are not customers. They are co-builders. Treat them that way.

## Landing Page (Day 55–60)

Single page. Five sections:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hero">
    **Headline**: "Your AI finally knows your design system"

    **Subhead**: "ForgeKit gives Claude complete awareness of your Figma and codebase — so your whole team stops guessing."

    **CTA**: "Join the beta" → email capture
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Problem">
    Three panels. Use the exact words heard in customer conversations:
    - "Designed but not built"
    - "Drifted without anyone noticing"
    - "New hire took 3 weeks to understand the components"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Demo Video">
    The 90-second recording. Full width. Autoplay muted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="How It Works">
    Three steps: Connect Figma → Connect codebase → Ask Claude anything
  </Step>
  <Step title="Beta CTA">
    "We're onboarding 20 teams this month."

    Email capture → you personally respond within 24 hours.

    No pricing page. "Beta — reach out for access" creates scarcity without deception.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pricing at Launch

One price. No tiers yet.

```
Beta price: $29/mo
Everything included.
Cancel anytime.
Price locks in forever for beta users.
```

**Why**: Simple. Creates urgency. Rewards early adopters. Gives a clean revenue signal — if people won't pay $29, pricing isn't the problem, product is.

Introduce tiers at v2 once you know which features teams use vs solo devs.

## The Metrics That Matter

Ignore vanity metrics. Track only:

| Timeframe | Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Week 1–4 | Conversations started | 20+ |
| Week 5–8 | Active beta installs | 5 |
| Week 8–12 | Daily MCP tool calls per user | 5+ (habit signal) |
| Week 12+ | Conversion to paid | 3/5 beta → paying |

**The critical signal**: If daily active calls per user is below 5, the product isn't sticky enough yet. Fix that before charging.

## Longer-Term GTM (Post-Beta)

Once 10+ teams are active:

- **Agency channel**: Agencies managing design systems for clients are high-value. One agency = multiple client projects at higher contract value.
- **Design system influencers**: People like Brad Frost, Zack Leatherman, or Storybook core team members reaching out matters more than ads.
- **Integration partnerships**: Getting listed in Figma's plugin directory, Storybook's ecosystem page, or Cursor's MCP registry = compounding inbound.
- **Enterprise inbound**: If the tool is working for startups, enterprise design system teams will find it. Have a "contact us" path ready.
