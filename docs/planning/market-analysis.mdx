# Market Analysis

## The Space We're Entering

ForgeKit Context sits at the intersection of three markets:

1. **Design-to-code tools** — saturated, commoditized, low differentiation
2. **Design system management** — underserved, high enterprise value
3. **AI developer tooling (MCP)** — first-mover window, almost no niche players

The opportunity is in the third category with the second category's value proposition. Not code generation — **AI context for design systems**.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Product | Direction | AI | Price | Key Gap |
|---------|-----------|-----|-------|---------|
| [story.to.design](https://story.to.design) | Storybook → Figma | None | $149/mo | One direction, no AI, no code gen |
| Anima | Figma → React | Minimal | $49/mo | No Storybook, no MCP, no sync |
| Locofy | Figma → React | Basic | $39/mo | No design system awareness |
| Builder.io | Figma → Code | Some | $99/mo | No Storybook, no team context |
| Zeroheight | DS docs | None | $149/mo | Static, no AI, no code awareness |
| Supernova | DS docs + tokens | None | $200+/mo | No AI, no gap analysis |

### Story.to.design — The Closest Competitor

The only product doing real Storybook ↔ Figma work. Key details:
- Goes **Storybook → Figma** (code is source of truth)
- 11,000+ users, 1M+ variants generated
- $149/mo per Storybook (no per-seat, just per Storybook)
- Agency plan: custom pricing for 2+ Storybooks
- No AI layer, no MCP, no code generation, no PM-readable output

**ForgeKit's angle**: We go the other direction (Figma ↔ Storybook, bidirectional) at $49–79/mo with an AI backbone that theirs fundamentally cannot have. They're a Figma plugin. We're an MCP-native platform.

### The Figma-to-Code Space (Why We're NOT There)

Tools like Anima, Locofy, Builder.io, Figma's own Dev Mode — this space is crowded and the quality varies wildly. Teams have tried and been burned by generated code that doesn't match their patterns.

**We're not a code generator.** We're an AI context layer. This is a critical positioning distinction.

## The Gap Nobody Has Filled

```
story.to.design:   Storybook ──→ Figma      (one direction)
Everyone else:     Figma ──→ Code            (generation, saturated)

ForgeKit Context:  Figma ←──→ Storybook ←──→ Production
                         (bidirectional, AI-native, team-aware)
```

The **bidirectional + AI-native + team-aware** combination is unbuilt. That's the moat.

## Market Size Signal

- story.to.design: 11,000+ users at $149/mo = ~$1.6M ARR if 10% convert to paid
- Zeroheight: raised $17M (design system docs alone justify VC funding)
- Chromatic (Storybook visual testing): used by tens of thousands of teams
- Design systems are a standard practice at any team with 3+ engineers

A tool that makes design systems AI-aware at $49–199/mo for teams that already spend $149/mo on story.to.design has a clear price anchor and willing buyers.

## Positioning Statement

**For product teams** who are tired of design and code being out of sync,

**ForgeKit Context** is an AI context MCP

**that** gives Claude and every AI tool in your workflow complete, always-current awareness of your design system —

**unlike** design-to-code generators and Figma plugins,

**ForgeKit** doesn't generate one-time code or sync in one direction. It makes your AI permanently aware of your team's full design/code state, so every discipline — design, dev, and product — works from the same source of truth.

## The Window

**Estimated first-mover window: 6–12 months.**

Risk factors:
- Anthropic builds native design system context into Claude
- Figma builds native AI developer features (already started with Dev Mode AI)
- A YC-backed startup enters with more resources

Mitigation: The distribution moat (ForgeKit ecosystem, existing npm users, community relationships) matters more than the technical moat. Build the brand and the user base before the window closes.
