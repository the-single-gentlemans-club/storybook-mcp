# ForgeKit Context — Product Overview

<Info>
This is internal planning documentation. It captures the product vision, market positioning, and strategic decisions for ForgeKit Context — the next product in the ForgeKit ecosystem.
</Info>

## The Problem

Every cross-discipline product team wastes 20–30% of engineering time on alignment overhead:

- Designers update Figma. Developers don't know.
- Developers build components. Designers don't know they exist.
- PMs can't answer "how far are we from shipping this?"
- New hires take weeks to understand the component library.
- AI tools (Claude, Cursor) have zero context about the team's actual design system.

The result is constant re-work, misalignment, and a gap between what's designed and what's shipped.

## The Solution

**ForgeKit Context** is an MCP server that gives Claude — and every team member using AI — complete, always-current awareness of a product team's design system.

Connect it once to Figma and the codebase. From that point on:

- Every AI tool your team uses knows your component library
- Every query is answered with real, accurate data about your specific system
- Design, dev, and product work from the same source of truth

## The One-Sentence Pitch

> "ForgeKit tells your AI exactly what's been built and what hasn't — so your whole team stops guessing."

## What ForgeKit Context Knows

```
Design layer
├── Every Figma component, its variants, its props
├── Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
├── What's been updated recently
└── Design decisions and annotations

Code layer
├── Every React component in the codebase
├── What Storybook stories exist
├── What's tested, what's documented
└── Component usage patterns

Gap layer (the killer feature)
├── Designed but not built yet
├── Built but drifted from the Figma spec
├── Exists in code but not in Figma
└── Missing stories or tests
```

## Target Audience

**Primary**: 2–10 person startups with at least one designer and one developer sharing a Figma file and a React codebase.

**Secondary**: Agencies managing design systems for multiple clients.

**Eventually**: Enterprise design system teams at scale.

## Product Tier Vision

| Tier | Price | Target | Core Value |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| Solo | $29/mo | Freelancers | One project, all features |
| Studio | $79/mo | Small teams (2–5) | Shared context, drift alerts |
| Product Team | $199/mo | Startup teams (5–15) | PM reports, onboarding, cross-discipline |
| Enterprise | Custom | Large orgs | Multi-repo, SSO, compliance |

**Beta launch**: Single price of $29/mo, everything included, locks in forever for beta users.

## ForgeKit Ecosystem

ForgeKit Context is built on top of three existing MCPs:

```
ForgeKit Context MCP       ← new product (orchestrator)
├── forgekit-storybook-mcp ← exists (v0.10.6, published)
├── forgekit-figma-mcp     ← exists (built)
└── forgekit-react-mcp     ← exists (built)
```

The three underlying MCPs are the hard part. ForgeKit Context is the product layer that makes them useful together as a team tool.

## Why Now

The MCP ecosystem is in its first-mover window. Most competitors are building generic MCPs. The niche of **design-system-aware AI context for product teams** is unbuilt. The window is estimated at 6–12 months before a well-funded player moves in.
